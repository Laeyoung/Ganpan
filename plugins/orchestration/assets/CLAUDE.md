# Repo conventions

## Commits (Conventional Commits — required)
Format: `type(scope): subject`
- `type` ∈ feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, build, ci.
- Body explains **what changed and why** (not "수정했습니다").
- Footer references the issue: `Closes #<n>`.

## Branches / worktrees
- One issue → branch `issue-<n>` → worktree `../wt-issue-<n>`.
- Never force-push or delete another worker's `wt-issue-*` branch.

## Merge gate
- Agents never approve or merge PRs. A human reviews and merges (branch protection enforces this).

## Reviewer lane — decision gate
- The Reviewer reads **trusted** human PR/issue comments (write+ permission or reviewer allowlist) and routes each in-review PR to rework / a human-decision gate (`status:needs-decision`) / an out-of-scope follow-up issue / a human merge request.
- Only bot-authored markers (`decision-requested:`/`decision-resolved:`/`decision-clarify:`/`followup-created:`/`cap-exceeded:`/`merge-requested:`) change lane state. Human text never does.
- Trust/cap policy lives in `.claude/orchestration.json` under `reviewer` (`permissionThreshold`, `allowlist`, `followupIssueCapPerPR`).
