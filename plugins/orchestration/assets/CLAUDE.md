# Repo conventions

## Commits (Conventional Commits — required)
Format: `type(scope): subject`
- `type` ∈ feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, build, ci.
- Body explains **what changed and why** (not "수정했습니다").
- Footer references the issue: `Closes #<n>`.

## Branches / worktrees
- One issue → branch `issue-<n>` → worktree `../wt-issue-<n>`.
- Never force-push or delete another worker's `wt-issue-*` branch.

## Merge gate
- Agents never approve or merge PRs. A human reviews and merges (branch protection enforces this).

## Bot identity
- Lanes verify `gh` is acting as `config.bot` before any write and **hard-stop** otherwise. Export the bot's fine-grained PAT first: `export GH_TOKEN=github_pat_...` (HTTPS). If a lane stops with "gh is acting as '<you>' but config.bot is '<bot>'", your `GH_TOKEN` is unset or wrong.
- `ORCH_SKIP_ACTOR_CHECK=1` bypasses the check — use it **per-invocation only** (e.g. CI where the bot PAT is the actor), never as a global export.
